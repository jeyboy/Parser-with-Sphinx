Install Sphinx
	Download library by link : http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads/
	
	The standard set of commands should install it with MySQL support:

		./configure
		make
		sudo make install

	If you need PostgreSQL support, youâ€™ll need to tell the Sphinx configuration step that. It could be as simple as a flag:

		./configure --with-pgsql

	But in some cases the path to the libraries will need to be explicitly set:

		./configure --with-pgsql=/usr/local/include/postgresql

	The libraries path can be determined by running the following command:

		pg_config --pkgincludedir
